# Launch Control XL

This controller extension only works with the factory templates; user templates are ignored because they're not predictable.

To switch between factory templates, press the Factory button (top right) and the bottom row of buttons becomes green.
Select one of the factory templates between 1 and 5.

## Volume faders

The eight volume faders always control the **track volume**. You can scroll the track bank using the track select arrows.

## Track focus

The track focus buttons always **selects** the track.

## Track control / Device Bank

This is a multi-function row of buttons.

You can configure their function by pushing one of the **Mute**, **Solo**, **Record Arm** or **Device** button on the right.
In case of device, it lets you select the *remote controls page* for the selected device.
